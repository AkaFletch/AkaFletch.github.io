      <description>Preparing LD47 Friday the 9th of October to Monday the 12th was Ludum Dare 47. A game jam where developers (try) make a game within the 3 day time period. The main event is actually the Friday-Sunday however I took part in the Jam. The theme for this Jam was &amp;ldquo;Stuck in a loop&amp;rdquo;
I had never taken part in a Ludum Dare by myself before.
Before the Jam I had decided to take part in the Jam since I was free on the weekend and thought it&amp;rsquo;d be interesting.</description>
