      <description>Digsite Following LD47 I was pretty annoyed at my complete inability to use OpenGL since it caused a lot of wasted hours and on the time limit I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to slow down and learn how to use it correctly. So following this I came up with a general idea for a game I want to make in 3D. It feels like a perfect practice ground for OpenGL and a perfect way to struggle my way through 3d game development.</description>

      <description>Preparing LD47 Friday the 9th of October to Monday the 12th was Ludum Dare 47. A game jam where developers (try) make a game within the 3 day time period. The main event is actually the Friday-Sunday however I took part in the Jam. The theme for this Jam was &amp;ldquo;Stuck in a loop&amp;rdquo;
I had never taken part in a Ludum Dare by myself before.
Before the Jam I had decided to take part in the Jam since I was free on the weekend and thought it&amp;rsquo;d be interesting.</description>
