      <description>Preparing LD47 Friday the 9th of October to Monday the 12th was Ludum Dare 47. A game jam where developers (try) make a game within the 3 day time period. The main event is actually the Friday-Sunday however I took part in the Jam. The theme for this Jam was &amp;ldquo;Stuck in a loop&amp;rdquo;
I had never taken part in a Ludum Dare by myself before.
Before the Jam I had decided to take part in the Jam since I was free on the weekend and thought it&amp;rsquo;d be interesting.</description>

      <description>New site I&amp;rsquo;ve had this site for like nearly a year now and I&amp;rsquo;ve never really made any posts. Infact, I put my generated site into git but not my source, and so I lost it all when I updated my computer. So I guess I&amp;rsquo;m making it again, this time I swear I&amp;rsquo;ll save the source in git.
Me I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer with intrests in:
 lowlevel programming embedded systems machine learning cyber security game development Not web tech  A big mix of unrelated things, and it turns out I&amp;rsquo;m not good at any of them.</description>
